We’ve come a long way since soya was the only plant-based kid on the block. From breakfast bowl to dreamy after dinner desserts, we’ve got you covered. We’ve added oats, rice, almonds, hazelnuts and coconut to our list of base ingredients. Good food starts with good ingredients. That’s why we shop local whenever we can and work closely with our farmers. Rainforest free non-GMO soya, Mediterranean almonds mostly watered by rain and naturally pollinated by insects, European oats, and the best hazelnuts, coconuts, rice and cashews we can find.
Who’d have thought that Belgian born Alpro would grow into something this big, all over Europe and in 50 countries around the world. In 2017 we joined the even bigger Danone family and added our plant-based placard to their ‘Food Revolution’ march. It’s a natural fit as we both share a single aim – what’s best for people and for the planet.
